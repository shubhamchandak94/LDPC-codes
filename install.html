<H1> Installing the LDPC Software </H1>

The LDPC software is written in C, and may well work with any C
compiler, though it has been tested only with gcc, in Unix and Linux
environments, and in the <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</A>
Unix-like environment that runs under Microsoft Windows.  The
installation instructions below assume that you are using a Unix-like
system.

<P>Download:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
git clone https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC-codes
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you prefer for this directory to be called something else,
rename it <B>now</B>, before compiling the programs, since the file
<TT>randfile</TT> in this directory, containing natural random numbers,
is accessed according to its path when the programs were compiled.

<P>You should now change into the
newly-created directory, and type
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If all goes well, this should compile all the programs (except for some
test programs, which can be compiled with <TT>make test</TT>).  You
may want to edit the file <TT>Makefile</TT> before running <TT>make</TT>
in order to change compilation options, such as the optimization level.

<P>You can run the programs from this source directory, or you can copy
them to some other directory by running the <TT>LDPC-install</TT>
shell file.  For instance, to install them in a bin directory in your
home directory, do the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
./LDPC-install $HOME/bin
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The source directory contains a copy of all the HTML files
documenting the software, such as the one you are reading now, with
the file <TT>index.html</TT> being the starting point. Just tell your
browser to open the URL
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
file:<I>path-to-software</I>/index.html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT><I>path-to-software</I></TT> is the full path (starting with "/")
to the directory where you've put the software.

<P>The command
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make clean
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will remove all the compiled programs, as well as the files created when
the <A HREF="examples.html">examples</A> are run, and <TT>core</TT>, if it
exists.
