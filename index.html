<H1> Software for Low Density Parity Check Codes </H1>

<P>This collection of programs and modules, written in C, is intended
to support research and education concerning Low Density Parity Check
(LDPC) codes.  (Note, however, that the copyright notice no longer
restricts use to these purposes).  These error-correcting codes were
invented by Robert Gallager in the early 1960's, and re-invented and
shown to have very good performance by David MacKay and myself in the
mid-1990's.  The decoding algorithm for LDPC codes is related to that
used for Turbo codes, and to probabilistic inference methods used in
other fields.  Variations on LDPC and Turbo codes are currently the
best practical codes known, in terms of their ability to transmit data
at rates approaching channel capacity with very low error probability.

<P>This is a fork of the original library by Radford Neal with the following major updates:
<ol>
    <li><b>Miscellaneous channel</b> - the original repository provided a few channels for decoding,
     such as binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.
     However in many applications other channels are required. In general, the LDPC
     decoding requires the channel only to compute the log-likelihood ratio (LLR). Thus,
     we introduce a <code>misc</code> channel where the input to the LDPC decoder are the LLRs.
     For any given channel, the LLRs can be computed from the received message and then the decoding can be
     run with the <code>misc</code> channel. More details are provided <a href="channel.html">here</a> and <a href="decoding.html#decode">here</a>.
     This channel was utilized in <a href="https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC_DNA_storage">https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC_DNA_storage<a/> for applying
     LDPC codes for DNA storage, and was also used to enable puncturing in an extension of this library to
     handle protograph LDPC codes
     (<a href="https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/ProtographLDPC/">https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/ProtographLDPC/</a>).</li>

     <li><b>Extracting positions of message bits in codeword</b> - The original library provides an <code>extract</code> functionality to obtain the
     message bits from the codeword. We provide an additional method <code>extract_systematic</code> to extract the positions of these bits in the codeword. This
     can be useful for certain applications where we need to know where where the message bits reside within the codeword.
     The documentation is available
     <a href="support.html#extract_systematic">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<P>Also see <a href="https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/ProtographLDPC/">https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/ProtographLDPC/</a>
which extends this library to construct protograph LDPC codes which can provide
both near-optimal asymptotic performance and excellent finite-block performance.
